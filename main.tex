\begin{abstract}
    The rapid growth of image datasets has made traditional image retrieval methods inefficient in terms of accuracy and scalability. Hashing-based techniques address this by encoding high-dimensional image data into compact binary codes, enabling fast retrieval with minimal storage. However, Deep Supervised Hashing (DSH) methods often struggle with quantization loss and suboptimal similarity preservation.

    This study explores a two-stage retrieval approach, where an initial fast search using hashing is followed by a refinement stage to improve ranking precision. We compare various DSH methods under this framework, analyzing their trade-offs between retrieval speed, accuracy, and computational efficiency. By standardizing evaluation metrics and testing across multiple datasets, we aim to provide clear insights into optimizing hashing-based image retrieval.
