\section{Introduction}


Hashing is a cornerstone of efficient image retrieval due to its ability to encode high-dimensional image features 
into compact binary representations. These binary hash codes allow for quick comparisons using Hamming distance, 
making hashing an essential technique for real-time applications. 

However, current approaches often fail to maximize the potential of hashing. 
Many hashing methods inadequately preserve semantic relationships between images, leading to reduced precision.
Challenges in scalability limit the deployment of hashing techniques for massive datasets.
The dynamic nature of visual content demands adaptive and robust hashing methods.

Deep learning offers an unprecedented opportunity to revolutionize hashing by enabling end-to-end learning frameworks 
where hash codes are directly optimized for retrieval tasks. This research seeks to push the boundaries of hashing 
methods, blending computational efficiency with semantic richness.


\subsection{Problem Statement}

With the exponential growth of image datasets, traditional image retrieval methods have become increasingly inefficient in terms of both accuracy and scalability. Conventional approaches struggle to handle the high-dimensional nature of image data, leading to slow retrieval speeds and excessive storage requirements. Hashing-based techniques offer a promising alternative by encoding images into compact binary codes, allowing for faster search operations with reduced memory consumption.

Despite the advancements in hashing-based retrieval, existing methods, particularly Deep Supervised Hashing, still face challenges. These include suboptimal hash code learning, difficulty in preserving semantic similarities, sensitivity to noise and variations in images, and computational overhead during training. Furthermore, many current models lack the ability to generalize well across diverse datasets, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios.

Therefore, there is a need to explore and develop improved Deep Supervised Hashing techniques that enhance retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. This research aims to investigate potential improvements to hashing methodologies, addressing key limitations and contributing to the development of more effective large-scale image retrieval systems.
